This program is made to play the game Othello
	If in case one does not know the rules or what Othello is check this
	link..

NOTE: The program I have written is still in progress.. 
	
	**2 humans can play this game against each other til the board gets filled.. Then the winner is evaluated
	
	** BLACK COIN - No 1
	** WHITE COIN - No 2
	
	**The aim for each player is to play a valid move by typing the coordinates of the location you want to place your coin on the board
	
THE PROGRAM IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT !!
	The part where the computer plays against one human is something I'm currently working on.. 
	ALL LEVELS OF THE COMP HAVE BEEN DONE SUCCESSFULLY
		Plz report if any bugs are found during gameplay
	
GUI DONE (UPTO SOME EXTENT)
	The GUI is programmed using ncurses.. Following are the modifications made 
	1)Color of text
	2) Start menu
	3) INTRODUCTION (Something that i really liked making)
	4) Game board 

I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS! 
	Plz feel free to suggest any changes I can make for this code! I would appreciate it!:))
								
								HAPPY CODING
