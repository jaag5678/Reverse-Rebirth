This program is made to play the game Othello
	If in case one does not know the rules or what Othello is check this
	link..

NOTE: The program I have written is still in progress..
	**It does not yet control the rule of "No avail moves then end 		game" 
	
	**However 2 people can play this game against each other til 		the board gets filled.. Then the winner is evaluated
	
	** BLACK COIN - No 1
	** WHITE COIN - No 2
	
	**The aim for each player is to play a valid move by typing the 	coordinates of the location you want to place your coin on the board
	
THE PROGRAM IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT !!
	The part where the computer plays against one human is something 		I'm currently working on.. Prt by part i would update the code I 		Upload...
	
GUI IS THE LAST STEP:
	The GUI for this game is something I'm gonna work in the 		end!!

I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS! 
	Plz feel free to suggest any changes I can make for this 		code! I would appreciate it!:))
